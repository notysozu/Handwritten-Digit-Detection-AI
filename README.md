# Handwritten Digit Detection AI 🧠✍️

An **offline handwritten digit recognition system** built using **Node.js, Express, EJS, and TensorFlow.js**.  
Users draw a digit (0–9) on a canvas, and the system predicts the digit locally using a CNN trained on the **MNIST dataset**.

> 🚫 No internet  
> 🚫 No cloud APIs  
> ✅ Fully offline AI

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd handwritten-digit-ai
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 🧠 Training the Model (IMPORTANT)

The model is not included in Git to keep the repo clean.
You must train it once before running the app.
```bash
node server/model/trainModel.js
```
This will:

1. Load the MNIST dataset
2. Train a high-accuracy CNN (~99.5%)
3. Save the model locally to:
